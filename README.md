[00:31.09] I want a cup that overflows with love
[00:35.32] Although it's not enough to fill my heart
[00:41.28] I want a barrel full of love
[00:46.98] Although I know it's not enough to fill my heart
[01:10.98] 
[00:52.86] I want a river full of love
[00:58.33] But then I know the holes will still remain
[01:06.03] I need an ocean full of love
[01:10.44] Although I know the holes will still remain
[01:31.94] 
[01:16.58] And this swiss-cheese heart knows
[01:20.65] Only kindness can fill its holes
[01:28.99] And love can dry my tears
[01:34.58] As pain disappears
[01:43.58] 
[01:40.03] I need a miracle and not someone's charity now
[01:45.86] One drop of love from him
[01:48.10] And my heart's in ecstasy
[01:50.87] The high that is sending me
[01:53.38] Is most likely ending me
[01:56.61] I need a miracle and not someone's charity now
[02:19.61] 
[02:30.78] Fill up my heart with love
[03:01.20] Oh, you'd be amazed at how little i need from him
[03:06.25] To feel complete here and now
[03:09.04] Stirring within me
[03:11.15] Are these feelings I can't ignore
[03:14.57] I need a miracle and that's what i'm hoping for
[03:38.07] 
[03:20.47] I need a miracle and not someone's charity now
[03:26.24] One drop of love from him
[03:28.27] And my heart's in ecstasy
[03:31.47] The high that is sending me
[03:34.28] Is most likely ending me
[03:37.43] I need a miracle and not someone's charity now
[03:46.33] Oh, baby
[03:50.33] 
[04:06.28] Anybody's love but his will never fill this space within me
[04:16.76] Now doctor, give me what i need to free my heart from misery
